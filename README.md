## Introduction

YLDHIT is a cross-chain risk-shift model designed to reshape how traders manage exposure across decentralized contract markets.

Instead of chasing predictions or reacting to volatility, YLDHIT analyzes the structural relationships between contracts—across chains, platforms, and market types—and continuously recalibrates a minimal hedging layer around your positions.

Using real-time correlation mapping, volatility curves, and deviation thresholds, the model identifies when your position begins drifting toward an unfavorable zone. 

At that moment, YLDHIT computes the smallest possible counter-position required to redirect the risk trajectory. 

This creates a dynamic “yield corridor” around your trades, allowing you to participate in upside while dramatically reducing tail exposure.

The system works across prediction markets, perpetuals, options, and custom on-chain contracts. 

YLDHIT does not attempt to guess outcomes; it simply maintains your position inside an optimized yield zone regardless of market direction. 

The result is a model that behaves less like a trading tool and more like an adaptive shield—preserving capital efficiency while enabling high-conviction strategies to stay alive longer, stabilize smoother, and capture more consistent returns.

YLDHIT transforms risk management from a static, manual process into a real-time, cross-market, self-adjusting mechanism that continuously works in your favor.

## > Why was YLDHIT created?

In the on-chain contract ecosystem, risk is never linear.

Perpetuals, options, prediction markets, and event contracts each amplify volatility in different ways.

And when traders hold positions across multiple platforms, assets, and contract types, the real danger no longer comes from price alone—it comes from hidden correlations, volatility spillover, event coupling, and structural mispricing.

The market gives us tools to trade, but not tools to manage how those tools interact.

Most traders rely on manual adjustments, instinctive hedging, or local signals from a single market.

When volatility hits, this often leads to unnecessary exposure—positions lose too fast when they shouldn’t, or profits evaporate long before they should.

YLDHIT was created to change that.

It is not a strategy and not a prediction model.

It is a cross-contract risk-shift model that identifies structural relationships between markets and calculates the minimal hedging required to push your positions back toward the optimal yield zone.

YLDHIT is designed as a new layer of infrastructure for on-chain traders.

You don’t need to be a quant, a mathematician, or a risk engineer—this model acts as an intelligent layer that continuously realigns risk for you in the background.

The purpose of YLDHIT is simple:

to give traders a more stable, longer-lasting, and higher-quality yield curve across the entire on-chain market.
